## realized identity management

Packets may form connections and sessions, but what ties all that together
conceptually is the **identity** they form. Allowing users to define their
identities within backpack to help models identify when they're improperly
segmented or mixed would give users something to grab on to, as far as total
concept goes.

Some components this would include:

- [ ] identity selectors
- [ ] password safe
- [ ] proxy/browser bundles (Tor etc.)

## automatic risk mitigation: zipper

(Discussed orally previously.)

There is probably a big subset of model-targeted behaviors/security risks that
can be mitigated by automatic means (usually a config change). This could be a
purely paid product.
