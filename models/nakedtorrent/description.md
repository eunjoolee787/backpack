## model description

this model is simple: it looks for unencrypted torrent traffic, and shames you (shame) for passing data like that.

### traffic definition

### alert conditions

Any unencrypted torrent traffic (a few packets just to confirm the connection is unencrypted *and* persistent) triggers an alert.

## report layout

The report gives a list of torrent names and time first detected.
