bad neighborhood (draft)
========

are you a bad enough dude?

## model description

this model is simple: it looks for traffic going directly or in the clear to sites known to be either shady or watched by invasive organizations, and alerts on detection of such.

### traffic definition

### alert conditions

Two alerts are possible:

1. direct connection
2. unencrypted connection

Either one of these is a bad choice.

## report layout

Report gives site name, blacklist reason, and alert type.
